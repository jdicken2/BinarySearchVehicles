Summary
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The repository holds all code used for programs in CS 351. They consist of various labs in C, and most are derived from a skeleton already given. The summary for each are below:
  1. A simple "Hello World" program
  2. A skeleton to a solution to a sudoku puzzle.
  3. A mock shell for running various commands such as spin and split.
  4. A cache simulator of log base 2. Determines whether the mock memory block would return a hit or miss.
  5. A lab for memory allocation, where students had to allocate  memory and free it, in order to realloc it. The lab uses a best fit         placement policy in order to place memory blocks in a location best suited for it's size.
